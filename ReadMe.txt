Bible Reader Program

To Use this bible reader program there are two options.

The first option is to run an instance of the biblelookup server and run a second instance
of the biblereader program with the following syntax to lookup a verse:
./biblereader book# chapter# verse#
EXAMPLE (Genesis 1:1 lookup): './biblereader 1 1 1'

The second way to access this program is through the web interface which provides a list
of posssible books in the Bible. This program has the additional feature of letting you
pick a book version and retrieve multiple verses. 
The book and version can be picked through provided lists but the chapter# verse# and
#ofVerses will have to be entered with an integer value.
